This is a little playground to play around with a esp32-c6 and a waveshare 7.5 inch e-paper E-Ink Diplay HAT

Currently it only runs weather forecast.

# Installation
To make this run, you need the environment variables `PASS`, `SSID` and `LOCATION`. The first two will be used for your wifi and the last one is the location for the weather forecast.
